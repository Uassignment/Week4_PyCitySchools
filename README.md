# Week4_PyCitySchools
# Overview of the school district analysis
The purpose of our analysis is to find the overall passing percentages of the students as well as the overall integrity of the test data. 
The analysis identified missing test scores for 9th graders at Thomas High School. 
To avoid calculation errors all missing results for reading and math scores from Thomas High School have been replaced with NaNs.


# Results
After taking a look at both district summaries from pycityschools and pycityschools_challenge there is not a change.
There was a 0.3% difference in the school summary, when recalculated with the missing test scores removed from the data. 
Removing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores doesn’t seem to affect the overall performance of Thomas High Schools.

Replacing the data didn’t affect the other high schools, however for a person who is reviewing the school’s data, data will show as null. 



The numbers stay nearly identical since the 9th graders are nullified from the statistics.
Overall passing percentage does not change.
Scores by school type are not altered at all.


#Conclusion
The analysis was able to identify and resolve issue to avoid possible calculation error on the over all analysis outcomes. 
Missing the 9th grader score hasn’t affect either the school or the district significantly.
